\title{Process sashimi plot data for visualization}
\usage{
process_sashimi_data(
  coverage_data,
  junction_data,
  region,
  junction_direction = c("alternate", "up", "down")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{coverage_data}{Coverage input: a data frame with seqnames, start, end, score columns,
or a file path to a bedGraph/bigWig file}

\item{junction_data}{Junction input: a data frame with seqnames, start, end, score columns,
or a file path to a BED file. start/end represent the splice junction coordinates.}

\item{region}{A genomic region string in the format "chr:start-end"}

\item{junction_direction}{Direction of junction arcs: "alternate" (default), "up", or "down"}
}
\value{
A list with two data frames: coverage_df and junction_df.
junction_df has additional columns: y_start, y_end (arc endpoint y-values),
arc_direction ("up" or "down" for each junction)
}
\description{
This function processes coverage and junction data for sashimi plot visualization.
It calculates y-positions for arc endpoints based on direction: "up" arcs start
at coverage height, "down" arcs start at zero, and "alternate" assigns alternating
directions to junctions sorted by start position.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
coverage <- data.frame(
  seqnames = "chr1", start = 1:100, end = 2:101, score = runif(100, 0, 10)
)
junctions <- data.frame(
  seqnames = "chr1", start = c(20, 40, 60), end = c(35, 55, 80), score = c(5, 10, 3)
)
result <- process_sashimi_data(coverage, junctions, "chr1:1-100")
}
