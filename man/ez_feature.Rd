\usage{
ez_feature(
  input,
  region,
  color = "black",
  fill = "gray70",
  alpha = 0.7,
  height = 0.8,
  use_score = FALSE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{input}{Either a file path to a BED file or a data frame containing
genomic coordinates with columns for chromosome, start, and end positions.}

\item{region}{Genomic region to display in the format "chr:start-end".
Example: "chr1:1000000-2000000"}

\item{color}{Border color of the features. Default: "black"}

\item{fill}{Fill color of the features. When \code{use_score = TRUE}, this will be
used as the high value in the color gradient. Default: "gray70"}

\item{alpha}{Transparency level of the features (0 = transparent, 1 = opaque).
Default: 0.7}

\item{height}{Height of the feature rectangles (0 to 1). Default: 0.8}

\item{use_score}{Logical indicating whether to use the 'score' column for
fill color. If TRUE, a gradient from white to the specified fill color will
be used. Default: FALSE}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{geom_feature()}}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object representing the feature track.
}
\description{
This function creates a feature track visualization from genomic regions,
such as peaks or other genomic annotations. It can read directly from BED files
or work with data frames containing genomic coordinates.
}
\details{
This function creates a peak track visualization from a BED file or data frame.
It is a wrapper around geom_feature that provides a simpler interface.

The function automatically handles both file paths and data frames as input.
When a file path is provided, it reads the BED file and creates the track.
When a data frame is provided, it should contain at least 'chrom', 'start',
and 'end' columns. If 'score' column is present and \code{use_score = TRUE},
features will be colored by their score values.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# From a BED file with score-based coloring
track1 <- ez_feature(
  "peaks.bed",
  "chr1:1000000-2000000",
  fill = "blue",
  use_score = TRUE
)

# From a data frame with uniform coloring
features <- data.frame(
  chrom = c("chr1", "chr1", "chr1"),
  start = c(1000, 3000, 5000),
  end = c(2000, 4000, 6000),
  name = c("peak1", "peak2", "peak3"),
  score = c(10, 30, 50)
)
track2 <- ez_feature(
  features,
  "chr1:1-10000",
  fill = "darkgreen",
  alpha = 0.8
)

# Combine with other tracks using aplot
ez_plot(list(
  "Features" = track1,
  "Genes" = track2
), "chr1:1-10000")
